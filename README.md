# Auto-mpg 

Auto-mpg is a small dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repo. 

Ipython notebook is uploaded in Project 1 folder which includes the Data cleaning + EDA + Building a neural network model to make predictions for cars miles per gallons. 
Below is the link to kaggle kernel for same notebook.

# Fashion MNIST

Fashion MNIST is a data set consisting of 60k training examples and 10k test examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. In this project we have trained a neural network model to identify the class of the image. More details and code in the iPython notebook.
